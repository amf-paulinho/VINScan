# Documentation

- The project is very simple and the code is clear not having the necessity of many comments.
- The project is using just extreme necessary third Party Libraries to facilitate UI/UX building (The UI/UX can be improved using for exemple React-Native Paper).
- The project is using React-Native CLI instead EXPO
- The project was built using Linux and Android and tested on Mac/IOS
- There are no Unit Test Project
- I have some other considerations to add during the interview.
